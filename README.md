TinyMesh
========

This is code produced inspired by IoT (Internet of Things) workshop with TinyMesh
technology held in HackerSpace.SG.

TinyMesh are modules build on CC11xx TI MCU transceivers that
allow for automatic meshing, and remote sensor reading.

We plan to use them for YAHI (Yet Another Haze Index),
and maybe other sensor networks measuring quality of living in different areas
of Singapore.
